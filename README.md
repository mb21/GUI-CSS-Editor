# CSS-Builder

For my rationale, see [Text processing: combining templates with WYSIWYG-styling](http://mb21.github.io/blog/2017/11/25/text-processing-combining-templates-with-WYSIWYG-styling.html)

## TODO

- [ ] handle inlines (currently, they get an `<aside>` as well)

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
